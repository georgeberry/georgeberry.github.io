### Bio

I'm a PhD candidate in sociology at Cornell University advised by Michael Macy. I study social contagion, homophily in networks, and online conversations. I have interests in moderation and design of online conversational spaces, particularly with deliberative discourse and misinformation in mind.

From September 2017 to February 2019, I was a full-time research scientist on Facebook's Core Data Science team (Core Stats / Interaction Science subteams). During this time I was part of Facebook's Election Integrity effort (you can see a shoutout of some of the work I did ahead of the 2017 Alabama special election [here](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-cnn-interview-transcript/index.html)). I then developed methods to better understand large public conversations, with a focus on understanding what particularly good interactions looked like in the contexts of large Pages and news stories. This work combined elements of graph kernels with participant surveys.
