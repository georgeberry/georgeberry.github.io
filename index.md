### Bio

I'm a PhD candidate in sociology at Cornell University advised by Michael Macy. I study social contagion, homophily in networks, and online conversations. I have interests in moderation and design of online conversational spaces, particularly with deliberative discourse and misinformation in mind.

From September 2017 to February 2019, I was a full-time research scientist on Facebook's Core Data Science team (Core Stats / Interaction Science subteams). During this time I was part of Facebook's Election Integrity effort (you can see press coverage of some of the work I did ahead of the 2017 Alabama special election [here](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-cnn-interview-transcript/index.html)). I then developed methods to better understand large public conversations, with a focus on understanding what particularly good interactions looked like in the contexts of large Pages and news stories. This worked combined elements of graph kernels with participant surveys to understand how particular types of interactions were perceived by people in those interactions. In this time, I also developed an interest in graph neural networks, and I remain optimistic that GNNs can be employed productively for sociological analysis.
