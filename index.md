### Bio

I'm a sociologist, data scientist, experimentalist, and builder. 

I obtained my PhD in 2020 from Cornell University, where I studied under Michael Macy. My academic interests include social contagion, homophily in networks, online conversations, and experimental design.

I have published on using [field experiments for studying online conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06677.pdf), on [challenges to studying cross-group connection in online environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11171.pdf), on [fundamental problems for studying social influence in networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02700.pdf), and on [methods for studying social similarity in the absence of explicit network information](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204990).

I have also written a (hopefully) clear [introduction to causal inference](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncvqs/) for folks studying web data.

### Work

From fall of 2019 to Winter of 2020, I was employed as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer (or Data Scientist, choose your own adventure here) at Civis Analytics. I worked on experimentation and building Bayesian models, particularly in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect detection. During the 2020 election cycle, I was the lead on the core ad-testing infrastructure at Civis. This system tested thousands of ads and was involved in allocating a substantial amount of ad spend (e.g. hundreds of millions of dollars) in the 2020 election cycle.

From September 2017 to February 2019, I was a full-time research scientist on Facebook's Core Data Science team (Core Stats / Interaction Science subteams). During this time I was part of Facebook's Election Integrity effort (you can see press coverage of some of the work I did ahead of the 2017 Alabama special election [here](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-cnn-interview-transcript/index.html)). I then developed methods to better understand large public conversations, with a focus on understanding what particularly good interactions looked like in the contexts of large Pages and News stories. This worked combined elements of graph kernels with participant surveys to understand how particular types of interactions were perceived by people in those interactions.

Other meaningful work experiences include time spent at Twitter and Graphika.
