I'm a sociologist, data scientist, experimentalist, and builder.

Right now, I am building a trading card business called **Card Shop Near Me** in Princeton Jct, NJ. You can visit us at [CardShopNear.Me](CardShopNear.Me), on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cardshopnearme), or in real life in the [Princeton area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/556ZVxcJBWcedQjs5)!

I am also developing an open source Bayesian layers package called [BLayers](https://github.com/georgeberry/blayers) on top of Jax + Numpyro.

I obtained my PhD in 2020 from Cornell University, where I studied under Michael Macy. My academic interests include social contagion, homophily in networks, online conversations, and experimental design.

Lately, I write on my [substack blog](https://georgeberry.substack.com/) before publishing elsewhere, and I'm active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/george_berry).

Some publications you may find interesting

* [Fundamental problems for studying social influence in networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02700.pdf)

I have also written a (hopefully) clear [introduction to causal inference](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncvqs/) for folks studying web data.

If you'd like my advice or input on something technical, reach out via email and we can discuss. I offer consulting on experimentation, causal inference, and Bayesian statistics.
