I'm a sociologist, data scientist, experimentalist, and builder. 

I obtained my PhD in 2020 from Cornell University, where I studied under Michael Macy. My academic interests include social contagion, homophily in networks, online conversations, and experimental design.

I have also written a (hopefully) clear [introduction to causal inference](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ncvqs/) for folks studying web data.
